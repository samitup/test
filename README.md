## Intro
This test involves a simple development task which we use for new employments in the development department. 

Feel free to choose this being a desktop application or a web application, but we expect that you demonstrate reasonable use of the available language functionality for abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, a good class structure and show a good programming practice. We are focused on code quality and good design, so it is nice if you add a design sketch. You will not be judged for correctness in the calculations or a fancy GUI.
The task should be solved using C# or Java. The solution should be returned with full source and if possible also as an executable binary or on a web server accessible using a web browser.

## Test description
Assume you are working for a software house producing applications for a wholesales retailers specialised in office furniture. Your clients needs software to support the process of importing goods and sell these to shops and chains. It is common to give rebates to customers based on various criteria like how much they sell, time of year, special deals etc. 

Make a simple program for calculating the price of a product that shows:
- a list of customers with rebate agreements
- a list of products with standard prices
- a list of product with adjusted prices for a selected customer

Then you will be asked to:
- Explain how the program can be extended to cater for different rebate types like volume discount and special product offers
- Show the extension points with interfaces, inheritance or other well known software patterns
